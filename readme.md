# Accessibility Guardian (VS Code Extension)

Catch the “Big 5” accessibility risks before they ship.

## Dev
```bash
npm install
npm run build
# F5 in VS Code -> Extension Development Host

### Breakdown:
- The top part (`# Accessibility Guardian...`) is your **title + tagline**.  
- Then `## Development` introduces the developer instructions.  
- The triple backticks (```bash … ```) define a **code block** so commands display nicely.

👉 If you want, I can extend this `README.md` with sections for **Features**, **Roadmap**, and **Packaging** (how to run `vsce package` and publish to the Marketplace). Would you like me to flesh it out into a more complete starter README?
